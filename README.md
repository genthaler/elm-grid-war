# elm-grid-war
My homage to the hex-based strategy games of yesterday

The various Elm hexagon libraries deal mostly with measurement and mutation,
nothing to do with display, so that's my lookout.

I'm looking for a vector image look rather than an 8-bit look,
so I'll go with SVG for the time being at least.

Otherwise I might have to fall back to gifs.

The initial vision is for
- landing page
- game selection page
- game play page
- unit purchase/attribute page


Feature list in no particular order:
- scalable graphics
- smooth animations
- smooth gameplay
- audio
- peer to peer play
- Electron app?
- (react-)native?
- keyboard controls
- show available moves
- show range of attack
- localstorage
- prove security properties
- schema versioning


So I'll need a way to display

```gherkin
Feature display a map

Scenario display a map with one texture

```
